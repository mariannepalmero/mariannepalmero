ðŸ‘‹ Hi, welcome to my research repository!

Iâ€™m @mariannepalmero, a researcher specializing in materials informatics. 
My work employs density functional theory and machine learning to advance
our understanding of materials. You'll find repositories that reflect my
research interests on my GitHub. These include projects and computational
tools developed that have helped me in analysis. Each repository has 
documentation to help others explore and build upon the work. If you wish
to ask me questions, you can reach me at mapalmero@up.edu.ph or
